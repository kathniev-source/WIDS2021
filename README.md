# WIDS2021

My project for Women in Data Science Datathon 2021. The topic is a binary classification problem: to determine whether a patient admitted to an ICU has been diagnosed with a particular type of diabetes, Diabetes Mellitus. The dataset used in the file can be downloaded via https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2021 .

The notebook includes a feature transformation section, a model building section, and a prediction section. Models used include Random Forest, XGB Classifier, and LGBM Classifier.
